5. **Tester**: Validates functionality through automated tests
6. **Validator**: Ensures each phase meets quality standards

## Component Interactions

- The **Coordinator** assigns tasks to appropriate microagents based on current phase
- The **Product Owner** creates user stories and acceptance criteria
- The **Architect** designs system components and interfaces
- The **Developer** implements features according to specifications
- The **Tester** writes automated tests for new functionality
- The **Validator** reviews completed work before progression

## Task Lifecycle

1. Tasks are created in the `.openhands/backlog` folder
2. Each task progresses through defined development phases
3. Microagents collaborate to complete tasks according to acceptance criteria
4. Validation occurs at each phase transition
5. Completed tasks are marked as finished and archived
